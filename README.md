# Rust LKM
A collection of tools and libraries to implement and build Linux Kernel Modules (LKMs) in Rust.

This project includes:
- `kmacro`: A procedural macro library to help with writing LKMs in Rust.
- `kmod`: A library providing abstractions and utilities for LKMs.
- `kmod-loader`: A kernel-space tool to load and manage Rust LKMs.
- `modules/hello`: An example "Hello, World!" kernel module written in Rust.
